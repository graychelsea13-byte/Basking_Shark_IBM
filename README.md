# BaskingShark_IBM
This model seeks to reproduce basking shark aggregation behavior in Ireland and to test what environmental and/or behavioral drivers lead to shark aggregations. The model reproduces a 10,545 km2 area around the Inishowen Peninsula of Ireland, divided into 1km2 patches which reflect only the top 10 meters of water.
