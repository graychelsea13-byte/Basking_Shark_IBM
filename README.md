# BaskingShark_IBM
This model seeks to reproduce basking shark aggregation behavior in Ireland and to test what environmental and/or behavioral drivers lead to shark aggregations. 

The model runs in Netlogo (Basking Shark IBM.nglogo). To run the model, you must also down the input files (found in the "Data" folder), which include the underlying map and zooplankton data.
